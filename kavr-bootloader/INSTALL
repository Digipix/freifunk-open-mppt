This directory contains a compiled and ready-to-use kavr bootloader image
that can be flashed into the Atmega8 microcontroller of the
Freifunk-Open-MPP-Tracker.  The kavr sources are available at

How to install the bootloader on a blank Atmega8 chip
#####################################################

Step one:
*********

You need to configure the AVR ATmega8 fuses first. Switch over to the Fuses
directory to set the fuses with AVR-Burn-O-Mat with an ISP-programmer, or use the
shell script in this folder.

Step two:
*********

After the fuses are set, the bootloader can be flashed. There is a simple
shell script that works with my programmer at hand (AVR
Dragon).

Simply executing

./program.sh

will flash the bootloader.

There is now a multitude of AVR ISP-programmers.  If you use a different
programmer, modify the script accordingly.
