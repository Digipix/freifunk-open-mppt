TODO:

The status of the project is working prototype software and hardware.

Schematic and PCB layout are currently not in sync, as I'm currently in the process of making some changes in the schematic.

I have etched two prototypes with the previous version of the schematic. They have been working straight away, but I'm currently testing/making some minor changes before I'm going into production.

The back side of the pcb is massive copper, minus a few mils of insulation around the non-GND pins of the pin headers. I haven't filled the back side with copper yet.
